## API key

At the top of the page in the **Your key** line is your current **API key**.

By default the **API key** is partially hidden, the full **API key** is only displayed immediately after generation. Therefore it is better to save the **API key** right after generation.

To generate a new API key click the **Update** button icon on the right side of the **Your key** line.
